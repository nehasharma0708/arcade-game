frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is a simple arcade game written in JavaScript. It is one of the projects in Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

The basic game engine and graphics were supplied by Udacity. Game logic and features such as modal on winning is developed by me.

This repository was cloned from this Udacity repository. So you can see exactly what was my starting point.
